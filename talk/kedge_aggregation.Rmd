## Hierarchical time series

A .remember[hierarchical time series] is a collection of several time series that are linked together in a hierarchical structure (unique structure).

```{r fcst-health, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="70%"}

  "Store 1",   "SKU2",
  "Store 1",   "SKU3",
  "Store 2",   "SKU4",
  "Store 2",   "SKU5"

## How to forecast hierarchical/grouped series?
.pull-left[
### Hierarchical series

### Hierarchical forecasting approaches

## Optimal reconceiliation

- This approach involves first generating independent base forecast for each series in the hierarchy. 
- As these base forecasts are independently generated they will not be “aggregate consistent” (i.e., they will not add up according to the hierarchical structure). 
- The optimal combination approach optimally combines the independent base forecasts and generates a set of revised forecasts that are as close as possible to the univariate forecasts but also aggregate consistently with the hierarchical structure.
- Unlike any other existing method, this approach uses all the information available within a hierarchy. 

---
## Research gaps

- There is a need to examine empirically the validity of these theoretical developments in supply chains 
- Very little research has examined the association between characteristics of time series and the performance of approaches
- The potential benefit of incorporating exogenous variables in a hierarchy structure still needs to be examined
- Using probabilistic forecasting in hierarchies instead of point forecast in supply chains
- The theoretical developments in this area do not support the count nature of time series
- Investigating the benefit beyond forecast accuracy
