Feature,Description
mean,mean 
var,Varince
cv,Coeifficnet of variation
trend,"Strength of trend, a value close to 1 indicate highly trended series"
seasonal_strength,"strength of seasonality, a value close to 1 indicate highly seaonal series"
entropy,Measure of how easy the series is to forecast. Entropy close to 0 shows a series  is easy to forecast
