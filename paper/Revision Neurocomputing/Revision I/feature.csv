Feature,Description
mean,Mean 
var,Variance
cv,Coefficient of variation
trend,"Strength of trend, a value close to 1 indicate highly trended series"
seasonal_strength,"Strength of seasonality, a value close to 1 indicate highly seaonal series"
entropy,Measure of how easy the series is to forecast. Entropy close to 0 shows a series  is easy to forecast
